Momentum Dashboard âœŒ

I used 4 different APIs, and I'm thinking of adding some informationâ€¦? Maybe a to-do list or a Note pad? 
Also made it into a Chrome Extension! Local for now..
 
Stack : HTML/CSS and JS 

Concept practiced : 
- Fetch 
- REST API
- Request ( URL) 
- JSON
- Async Javascript 
- Await 
- Promise and rejection 
- Catch error 
- .then()
- DOM manipulation 

I would love some feedback ðŸ˜—
